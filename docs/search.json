Informally speaking, an object is a bundle of properties and actions about something specific. For example, an object could represent a data frame with properties such as number of rows, names of columns, and date created, and actions suchs as selecting a specific row or adding a new column.\nA variable is the name we give a specific object, and the same object can be referenced by different variables. An analogy for this is the following: the Sun (object) is called “sol” in Spanish and “soleil” in French, so two different names (variables) represent the same object. You can read more technical details about the difference between objects and variables in Python here.\nIn practice, we can often use the word variable and object interchangeably. I want to bring up what objects are so you’re not caught off-guard with vocabulary you’ll often encounter in the documentation, StackExchange, etc. We’ll often use the word object too (for example, in the next subsection!)."

The NumPy type numpy.int64 is telling us 1 is an integer stored as a 64-bit number. NumPy has its own data types to deal with numbers depending on memory storage and floating point precision, click here to know see all the types.\nSince “everything in Python is an object” and every object has a class, we will interact with SO MANY classes in this course.

You can see a list of them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument or Parameter?\n\n\n\nWe can interchangeably say arguments or parameters. You will see argument more often in the documentation.\n\n\nWe can ask for information about a function by executing ? followed by the function name:\n\n?print\n\n\nThe first line is always the function showing all of its arguments in parenthesis. Then there is a short description of what the function does. And finally a list of the arguments and a brief explanation about each of them.\nYou can see there are different types of arguments inside the parenthesis. Roughly speaking, a function has two types of arguments:\n\nnon-optional arguments: arguments you need to specify for the function to do something, and\noptional arguments: arguments that are pre-filled with a default value by the function, but you can override them. Optional arguments appear inside the parenthesis () in the form optional_argument = default_value.\n\nExample:\nend is an argument in print with the default value a new line. We can change this argument so that finishes the line with ^_^ instead:\n\n# notice we had always used print withough specifying any value for the `end` argument\nprint('I am changing the default end argument of the print function', end=' ^_^')\n\nI am changing the default end argument of the print function ^_^"

    "section": "1.7 Attributes & Methods",
    "text": "1.7 Attributes & Methods\nAn object in Python has attributes and methods. An attribute is a property of the object, some piece of information about it. A method is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods a class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable’s attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable’s name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a class fish, make a diagram similar to the cat class diagram showing 3 attributes for the class and 3 methods.\n\n\nExample\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let’s see some concrete examples.\n\n# define a 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\n\n# T is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n\n\n\n# shape, another attribute, tells us the shape of the array (3x3)\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n<class 'tuple'>\n\n\n\n# ndim is an attribute holding the number of array dimensions\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n<class 'int'>\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw tuples and int, two of the core Python classes, and also a numpy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods:\n\n# the tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\n\n# the min method returns the minimum value in the array along an axis\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can check this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array’s methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python\n\n\n\nIn R we don’t use methods within an object. Rather, functions are extrinsic to (outside) the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# this is R code\nvar <- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator %>% in R’s tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# this is R code\nvar <- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar %>% min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe %>% is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is essentially what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# this is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information."

    "text": "2.3 Series\nThe first core data structure of pandas is the series. A series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. A pandas.Series having an index is the main difference between a pandas.Series and a numpy array. See the difference:\n\n# a numpy array\n# np.random.randn returns values from the std normal distribution\narr = np.random.randn(4) \nprint(type(arr))\nprint(arr, \"\\n\")\n\n# a pandas series made from the previous array\ns = pd.Series(arr)\nprint(type(s))\nprint(s)\n\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n[-0.40041952  0.50751061 -0.5017382   0.21836539] \n\n<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n0   -0.400420\n1    0.507511\n2   -0.501738\n3    0.218365\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Creating a pandas.Series\nThe basic method to create a pandas.Series is to call\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\nThe data parameter can be:\n\na numpy array or a list\na Python dictionary\na number\n\nThe index parameter is a list of index labels.\nFor now, we will create a pandas.Series from a numpy array or list. To use this method we need to pass a numpy array (or a list of objects that can be converted to NumPy types) as data and a list of indices of the same length as data.\n\n# a Series from a numpy array \npd.Series(np.arange(3), index=['a','b','c'])\n\na    0\nb    1\nc    2\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThe index parameter is optional. If we don’t include it, the default is to make the index equal to [0,...,len(data)-1]. For example:\n\n# a Series from a list of strings with default index\npd.Series(['EDS 220', 'EDS 222', 'EDS 223', 'EDS 242'])\n\n0    EDS 220\n1    EDS 222\n2    EDS 223\n3    EDS 242\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Simple operations\nArithmetic operations work on series and also most NumPy functions. For example:\n\n# define a series\ns = pd.Series([98,73,65],index=['Andrea', 'Beth', 'Carolina'])\n\n# divide each element in series by 10\nprint(s /10, '\\n')\n\n# take the exponential of each element in series\nprint(np.exp(s), '\\n')\n\n# notice this doesn't change the values of our series\nprint(s)\n\nAndrea      9.8\nBeth        7.3\nCarolina    6.5\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      3.637971e+42\nBeth        5.052394e+31\nCarolina    1.694889e+28\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      98\nBeth        73\nCarolina    65\ndtype: int64\n\n\nWe can also produce new pandas.Series with True/False values indicating whether the elements in a series satisfy a condition or not:\n\ns > 10\n\nAndrea      True\nBeth        True\nCarolina    True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nThis kind of simple conditions on pandas.Series will be key when we are selecting data from data frames.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Attributes & Methods\npandas.Series have many attributes and methods, you can see a full list in the pandas documentation. For now we will cover two examples that have to do with identifying missing values.\npandas represents a missing or NA value with NaN, which stands for not a number. Let’s construct a small series with some NA values:\n\n# series with NAs in it\ns = pd.Series([1, 2, np.NaN, 4, np.NaN])\n\nA pandas.Series has an attribute called hasnans that returns True if there are any NaNs:\n\n# check if series has NAs\ns.hasnans\n\nTrue\n\n\nThen we might be intersted in knowing which elements in the series are NAs. We can do this using the isna method:\n\ns.isna()\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2     True\n3    False\n4     True\ndtype: bool\n\n\nWe can see the ouput is a pd.Series of boolean values indicating if an element in the row at the given index is NA (True = is NA) or not (False = not NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmoving on\n\n\n\nThere’s much more to say about pandas.Series, but this is enought to get us going. At this point, we mainly want to know about pandas.Series because pandas.Series are the columns of pandas.DataFrames."

The column descriptions are:\n\nyear: ​calendar year\neurope - antarctica: ​change in glacial volume (km3​ ​) in each region that year\nglobal_glacial_volume_change: ​cumulative​ global glacial volume change (km3), starting in 1961\nannual_sea_level_rise: ​annual rise in sea level (mm)\ncumulative_sea_level_rise:​ cumulative rise in sea level (mm) since 1961\n\nFirst, we read-in the file and get some baisc information about this data frame:\n\n# read in file\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/lesson-1/glacial_loss.csv')\n\n# see the first five rows\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      year\n      europe\n      arctic\n      alaska\n      asia\n      north_america\n      south_america\n      antarctica\n      global_glacial_volume_change\n      annual_sea_level_rise\n      cumulative_sea_level_rise\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1961\n      -5.128903\n      -108.382987\n      -18.721190\n      -32.350759\n      -14.359007\n      -4.739367\n      -35.116389\n      -220.823515\n      0.610010\n      0.610010\n    \n    \n      1\n      1962\n      5.576282\n      -173.252450\n      -24.324790\n      -4.675440\n      -2.161842\n      -13.694367\n      -78.222887\n      -514.269862\n      0.810625\n      1.420635\n    \n    \n      2\n      1963\n      -10.123105\n      -0.423751\n      -2.047567\n      -3.027298\n      -27.535881\n      3.419633\n      3.765109\n      -550.575640\n      0.100292\n      1.520927\n    \n    \n      3\n      1964\n      -4.508358\n      20.070148\n      0.477800\n      -18.675385\n      -2.248286\n      20.732633\n      14.853096\n      -519.589859\n      -0.085596\n      1.435331\n    \n    \n      4\n      1965\n      10.629385\n      43.695389\n      -0.115332\n      -18.414602\n      -19.398765\n      6.862102\n      22.793484\n      -473.112003\n      -0.128392\n      1.306939\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# get column names\ndf.columns\n\nIndex(['year', 'europe', 'arctic', 'alaska', 'asia', 'north_america',\n       'south_america', 'antarctica', 'global_glacial_volume_change',\n       'annual_sea_level_rise', 'cumulative_sea_level_rise'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n# check the data types of each column\ndf.dtypes\n\nyear                              int64\neurope                          float64\narctic                          float64\nalaska                          float64\nasia                            float64\nnorth_america                   float64\nsouth_america                   float64\nantarctica                      float64\nglobal_glacial_volume_change    float64\nannual_sea_level_rise           float64\ncumulative_sea_level_rise       float64\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n# data frame's shape: output is a tuple (# rows, # columns)\ndf.shape\n\n(43, 11)\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Selecting a single column…\n\n2.5.1.1 …by column name\nThis is the simplest case for selecting data. Suppose we are interested in the annual sea level rise. Then we can access that single column in this way:\n\n# seelect a single column by using square brackets []\nannual_rise = df['annual_sea_level_rise']\n\n# check the type of the ouput\nprint(type(annual_rise))\n\nannual_rise.head()\n\n<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n\n\n0    0.610010\n1    0.810625\n2    0.100292\n3   -0.085596\n4   -0.128392\nName: annual_sea_level_rise, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince we only selected a single column the output is a pandas.Series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.DataFrame = dictionary of columns\n\n\n\nRemember we can think of a pandas.DataFrame as a dictionary of its columns? Then we can access a single column using the column name as the key, just like we would do in a dictionary. That is the we just used: df['column_name'].\n\n\nThis is an example of selecting by label, which means we want to select data from our data frame using the names of the columns, not their position.\n\n\n2.5.1.2 … with attribute syntax\nWe can also access a single column by using attribute syntax:\n\nannual_rise_2 = df.annual_sea_level_rise\nannual_rise_2.head()\n\n0    0.610010\n1    0.810625\n2    0.100292\n3   -0.085596\n4   -0.128392\nName: annual_sea_level_rise, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Selecting multiple columns…\n\n2.5.2.1 … using a list of column names\nThis is another example of selecting by labels. We just need to pass a list with the column names to the square brackets []. For example, say we want to look at the change in glacial volume in Europe and Asia, then we can select those columns like this:\n\n# select columns with names \"europe\" and \"asia\"\neurope_asia = df[['europe','asia']]\n\nNotice there are double square brackets. This is because we are passing the list of names ['europe','asia'] to the selection brakcets [].\n\n# check the type of the resulting selection\nprint(type(europe_asia))\n\n# check the shape of the selection\nprint((europe_asia.shape))\n\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n(43, 2)\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2.2 … using a slice\nYet another example of selecting by label! In this case we will use the loc function. This is a powerful function! The general syntax is\ndf.loc[ row-selection , column-selection]\nwhere row-selection and column-selection are the rows and columns we want to subset from the data frame.\nLet’s start by a simple example, where we want to select a slice of columns, say the change in glacial volume per year in all regions. This corresponds to all columns between arctic and antarctica.\n\n# select all columns between 'arctic' and 'antarctica'\nall_regions = df.loc[:,'arctic':'antarctica']\nall_regions.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      arctic\n      alaska\n      asia\n      north_america\n      south_america\n      antarctica\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      -108.382987\n      -18.721190\n      -32.350759\n      -14.359007\n      -4.739367\n      -35.116389\n    \n    \n      1\n      -173.252450\n      -24.324790\n      -4.675440\n      -2.161842\n      -13.694367\n      -78.222887\n    \n    \n      2\n      -0.423751\n      -2.047567\n      -3.027298\n      -27.535881\n      3.419633\n      3.765109\n    \n    \n      3\n      20.070148\n      0.477800\n      -18.675385\n      -2.248286\n      20.732633\n      14.853096\n    \n    \n      4\n      43.695389\n      -0.115332\n      -18.414602\n      -19.398765\n      6.862102\n      22.793484\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNotice two things:\n\nwe used the colon : as the row-selection parameter, which means “select all the rows”\nthe slice of the data frame we got includes both endpoints of the slice 'arctic':'antarctica'. In other words we get the arctic column and the antarctica column. This is different from how slicing works in base Python and NumPy, where the end point is not included.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Selecting rows…\nNow that we are familiar with some methods for selecting columns, let’s move on to selecting rows.\n\n2.5.3.1 … using a condition\nSelecting which rows satisfy a particular condition is, in my experience, the most usual kind of row subsetting. The general syntax for this type of selection is df[condition_on_rows]. For example, suppose we are intersted in all data after 1996. We can select those rows in this way:\n\n# select all rows with year > 1996\nafter_96 = df[df['year']>1996]\nafter_96\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      year\n      europe\n      arctic\n      alaska\n      asia\n      north_america\n      south_america\n      antarctica\n      global_glacial_volume_change\n      annual_sea_level_rise\n      cumulative_sea_level_rise\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      36\n      1997\n      -13.724106\n      -24.832246\n      -167.229145\n      -34.406403\n      -27.680661\n      -38.213286\n      -20.179090\n      -4600.686013\n      0.909625\n      12.709077\n    \n    \n      37\n      1998\n      -13.083338\n      -110.429302\n      -107.879027\n      -58.115702\n      30.169987\n      -3.797978\n      -48.129928\n      -4914.831966\n      0.867807\n      13.576884\n    \n    \n      38\n      1999\n      -8.039555\n      -64.644068\n      -87.714653\n      -26.211723\n      5.888512\n      -8.038630\n      -40.653001\n      -5146.368231\n      0.639603\n      14.216487\n    \n    \n      39\n      2000\n      -17.008590\n      -96.494055\n      -44.445000\n      -37.518173\n      -29.191986\n      -2.767698\n      -58.873830\n      -5435.317175\n      0.798202\n      15.014688\n    \n    \n      40\n      2001\n      -8.419109\n      -145.415483\n      -55.749505\n      -35.977022\n      -0.926134\n      7.553503\n      -86.774675\n      -5764.039931\n      0.908074\n      15.922762\n    \n    \n      41\n      2002\n      -3.392361\n      -48.718943\n      -87.120000\n      -36.127226\n      -27.853498\n      -13.484593\n      -30.203960\n      -6013.225500\n      0.688358\n      16.611120\n    \n    \n      42\n      2003\n      -3.392361\n      -48.718943\n      -67.253634\n      -36.021991\n      -75.066475\n      -13.223430\n      -30.203960\n      -6289.640976\n      0.763579\n      17.374699\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nLet’s break down what is happening here. In this case the condition for our rows is df['year']>1996, this checks which rows have a value greater than 1996 in the year column. Let’s see this explicitely:\n\n# check the type of df['year']>1996\nprint(type(df['year']>1996))\n\ndf['year']>1996\n\n<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n\n\n0     False\n1     False\n2     False\n3     False\n4     False\n5     False\n6     False\n7     False\n8     False\n9     False\n10    False\n11    False\n12    False\n13    False\n14    False\n15    False\n16    False\n17    False\n18    False\n19    False\n20    False\n21    False\n22    False\n23    False\n24    False\n25    False\n26    False\n27    False\n28    False\n29    False\n30    False\n31    False\n32    False\n33    False\n34    False\n35    False\n36     True\n37     True\n38     True\n39     True\n40     True\n41     True\n42     True\nName: year, dtype: bool\n\n\nThe output is a pandas.Series with boolean values (True or False) indicating which rows satisfy the condition year>1996. When we pass such a series of boolean values to the selection brackets [] we keep only those rows with a True value.\nHere’s another example of using a condition. Suppose we want to look at data from years 1970 to 1979. One way of doing this is to use the in operator in our condition:\n\nseventies = df[df['year'].isin(range(1970,1980))]\nseventies\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      year\n      europe\n      arctic\n

pandas.Series,\nin df['year'].isin(), we have that isin is a method for the pandas.Series and we are calling it using the dot ..\nrange(1970,1980) constructs consecutive integers from 1970 to 1979 - remember the right endopoint (1980) is not included!\ndf['year'].isin(range(1970,1980)) is then a pandas.Series of boolean values indicating which rows have year equal to 1970, …, 1979.\nwhen we put df['year'].isin(range(1970,1980)) inside the selection brackets [] we obtain the rows of the data frame with year equal to 1970, …, 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nloc for row selection\n\n\n\nIt is equivalent to write\n# select rows with year<1965\ndf[df['year'] < 1965]\nand\n# select rows with year<1965 using love\ndf.loc[ df['year'] <1965 , :]\nIn the second one:\n\nwe are using the df.loc[ row-selection , column-selection] syntax\nthe row-selection parameter is the condition df['year']<1965\nthe column-selection parameter is a colon :, which indicates we want all columns for the rows we are selecting.\n\nWe prefer the first syntax when we are selecting rows and not columns since it is simpler.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3.2 … using multiple conditions\nWe can combine multipe conditions by surrounding each one in parenthesis () and using the or operator | and the and operator and.\nor example:\n\n# select rows with \n# annual_sea_level_rise<0.5 mm OR annual_sea_level_rise>0.8 mm\n\ndf[

These parameters can be a condition (which generates a boolean array) or a subset of labels from the index or the column names. Let’s see an examples:\n\n# select change in glacial volume in Europe per year after 2000\ndf.loc[df['year']>2000,['year','europe']]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      year\n      europe\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      40\n      2001\n      -8.419109\n    \n    \n      41\n      2002\n      -3.392361\n    \n    \n      42\n      2003\n      -3.392361\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nwe are using the df.loc[ row-selection , column-selection] syntax\nthe row-selection parameter is the condition df['year']>1990, which is a boolean array saying which years are greater than 1990\nthe column-selection parameter is ['year','europe'] which is a list with the names of the two columns we are intersted in.\n\n\n\n2.5.4.2 … by position\nWhen we want to select rows and columns simultaneously by position we use the iloc method with the syntax:\ndf.iloc[ row-indices , column-indices]\nFor example,\n\n# select rows 3-7 (including 7) and columns 3 and 4\ndf.iloc[ 3:8, [3,4] ]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      alaska\n      asia\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      3\n      0.477800\n      -18.675385\n    \n    \n      4\n      -0.115332\n      -18.414602\n    \n    \n      5\n      0.224762\n      -14.630284\n    \n    \n      6\n      -7.174030\n      -39.013695\n    \n    \n      7\n      -0.660556\n      7.879589\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nwe are using the df.iloc[ row-indices , column-indices] syntax\nthe row-indices parameter is the slice of integer indices 3:8. Remember the right endpoint (8) won’t be included.\nthe column-indices parameter is the list of integer indices 3 and 4. This means we are selecting the fourth and fifth column.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Notes about loc and iloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc vs. loc\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the difference between iloc and loc can be confusing. Remember the i in iloc stands for integer-location, so this function only uses integer indexing to retrieve information from the data frames in the same way as indexing for Python lists.\nIf you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between iloc and loc: Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?\nAnd, as always, the documentation will provide you with more information: pandas.DataFrame.loc and pandas.DataFrame.iloc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc for column selection? Avoid it!\n\n\n\nWe can also access columns by position using iloc - but it is best not to if possible.\nSuppose we want to access the 10th column in the data frame - then we want to select a column by position. In this case the 10th column is the annual sea level rise data and the 10th position corresponds to the index 9. We can select this column by position using the iloc method*:\n\n# select column by position using iloc\n# the syntax is iloc[rows,columns]\n# [:,9] means \"select all rows from the 10th column\"\nannual_rise_3 = df.iloc[:,9]\nannual_rise_3.head()\n\n0    0.610010\n1    0.810625\n2    0.100292\n3   -0.085596\n4   -0.128392\nName: annual_sea_level_rise, dtype: float64\n\n\nUnless you are really looking for information about the 10th column, do not access a column by position. This is bound to break in many ways:\n\nit relies on a person correctly counting the position of a column. Even with a small dataset this can be prone to error.\nit is not explicit: if we want information about sea level rise df.annual_sea_level_rise or df['annual_sea_level_rise'] are explicitely telling us we are accessing that information. df.iloc[:,9] is obscure and uninformative.\ndatastets can get updated. Maybe a new column was added before annual_sea_level_rise, this would change the position of the column, which would make any code depending on df.iloc[:,9] invalid. Accessing by label helps reproducibility!"
