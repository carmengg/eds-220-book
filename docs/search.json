Additionally, numpy objects have been optimized for processing, so computations on them are really fast and use less memory than doing the equivalent using base Python.\nIn this lesson we will use numpy to review some core concepts in Python you’re already familiar with.\nFirst, let’s start by importing the library:\n\nimport numpy as np"

In this course we will name variables using snake_case, where words are all in small caps and separated by underscores (ex: miles_run). This is the naming convention suggested by the Style Guide for Python Code."

    "text": "1.4 Variables and Objects\nYou will often encounter the word object in Python documentation and tutorials. Informally speaking, an object is a bundle of properties and actions about something specific. For example, an object could represent a data frame with properties such as number of rows, names of columns, and date created, and actions suchs as selecting a specific row or adding a new column.\nA variable is the name we give a specific object, and the same object can be referenced by different variables. An analogy for this is the following: the Sun (object) is called “sol” in Spanish and “soleil” in French, so two different names (variables) represent the same object. You can read more technical details about the difference between objects and variables in Python here.\nIn practice, we can often use the word variable and object interchangeably. I want to bring up what objects are so you’re not caught off-guard with vocabulary you’ll often encounter in the documentation, StackExchange, etc. We’ll often use the word object too (for example, in the next subsection!)."

    "text": "1.5 Types\nEvery object in Python has a type, the type tells us what kind of object it is. We can also call the type of an object, the class of an object (so class and type both mean what kind of object we have).\nWe can see the type/class of a variable/object by using the type function:\n\nprint(a)\ntype(a)\n\n[[1 1 2]\n [3 5 8]]\n\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\nThe numpy.ndarray is the core object/data type in the NumPy pakcage. We can check the type of an entry in the array by indexing:\n\nprint(a[0,0])\ntype(a[0,0])\n\n1\n\n\nnumpy.int64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nHow would you access the value 4 in the array a? Remember indexing in Python starts from 0!\n\n\nNotice the type of the value 1 in the array is numpy.int64 and not just the core Python integer type int. The NumPy type numpy.int64 is telling us 1 is an integer stored as a 64-bit number. NumPy has its own data types to deal with numbers depending on memory storage and floating point precision, click here to know see all the types.\nSince “everything in Python is an object” and every object has a class, we will interact with SO MANY classes in this course. Often, knowing the type of an object is the first step to finding information to code what you want!"

    "text": "1.6 Functions\nprint was our first example of a Python function. Functions take in a set of arguments, separated by commas, and use those arguments to create some output. There are several built-in funcions in Python, most of them are for interacting with the basic Python data types. You can see a list of them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument or Parameter?\n\n\n\nWe can interchangeably say arguments or parameters. You will see argument more often in the documentation.\n\n\nWe can ask for information about a function by executing ? followed by the function name:\n\n?print\n\n\nThe first line is always the function showing all of its arguments in parenthesis. Then there is a short description of what the function does. And finally a list of the arguments and a brief explanation about each of them.\nYou can see there are different types of arguments inside the parenthesis. Roughly speaking, a function has two types of arguments:\n\nnon-default arguments: arguments you need to specify for the function to do something, and\ndefault arguments: arguments that are pre-filled in by the function, but you can override them. Default arguments appear inside the parenthesis () in the form default_argument = default_value.\n\nExample:\nend is an argument in print with the default value a new line. We can change this argument so that finishes the line with ^_^ instead:\n\n# notice we had always used print withough specifying any value for the `end` argument\nprint('I am changing the default end argument of the print function', end=' ^_^')\n\nI am changing the default end argument of the print function ^_^"

    "section": "1.7 Attributes & Methods",
    "text": "1.7 Attributes & Methods\nAn object in Python has attributes and methods. An attribute is a property of the object, some piece of information about it. A method is is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods a class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable’s attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable’s name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\nExample\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let’s see some concrete examples.\n\n# define a 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\n\n# T is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n\n\n\n# shape, another attribute, tells us the array dimensions\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n<class 'tuple'>\n\n\n\n# ndim is an attribute hilding the number of array dimensions.\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n<class 'int'>\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw tuples and int, two of the core Python classes, and also a numpy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods:\n\n# the tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\n\n# the min method returns the minimum value in the array along an axis\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can check this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array’s methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python\n\n\n\nIn R we don’t use methods within an object. Rather, functions are extrinsic to (outside) the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# this is R code\nvar <- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator % in R’s tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# this is R code\nvar <- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar % min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe % is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is essentially what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# this is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information."
