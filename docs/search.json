    "text": "1.4 Variables and Objects\nYou will often encounter the word object in Python documentation and tutorials. Informally speaking, an object is a bundle of properties and actions about something specific. For example, an object could represent a data frame with properties such as number of rows, names of columns, and date created, and actions suchs as selecting a specific row or adding a new column.\nA variable is the name we give a specific object, and the same object can be referenced by different variables. An analogy for this is the following: the Sun (object) is called “sol” in Spanish and “soleil” in French, so two different names (variables) represent the same object. You can read more technical details about the difference between objects and variables in Python here.\nIn practice, we can often use the word variable and object interchangeably. I want to bring up what objects are so you’re not caught off-guard with vocabulary you’ll often encounter in the documentation, StackExchange, etc. We’ll often use the word object too (for example, in the next subsection!)."

We can also call the type of an object, the class of an object (so class and type both mean what kind of object we have).\nWe can see the type/class of a variable/object by using the type function:\n\nprint(a)\ntype(a)\n\n[[1 1 2]\n [3 5 8]]\n\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\nThe numpy.ndarray is the core object/data type in the NumPy pakcage.

The NumPy type numpy.int64 is telling us 1 is an integer stored as a 64-bit number. NumPy has its own data types to deal with numbers depending on memory storage and floating point precision, click here to know see all the types.\nSince “everything in Python is an object” and every object has a class, we will interact with SO MANY classes in this course. Often, knowing the type of an object is the first step to finding information to code what you want!"

There are several built-in funcions in Python, most of them are for interacting with the basic Python data types. You can see a list of them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument or Parameter?\n\n\n\nWe can interchangeably say arguments or parameters. You will see argument more often in the documentation.\n\n\nWe can ask for information about a function by executing ? followed by the function name:\n\n?print\n\n\nThe first line is always the function showing all of its arguments in parenthesis. Then there is a short description of what the function does. And finally a list of the arguments and a brief explanation about each of them.\nYou can see there are different types of arguments inside the parenthesis. Roughly speaking, a function has two types of arguments:\n\nnon-optional arguments: arguments you need to specify for the function to do something, and\noptional arguments: arguments that are pre-filled with a default value by the function, but you can override them. Optional arguments appear inside the parenthesis () in the form optional_argument = default_value.\n\nExample:\nend is an argument in print with the default value a new line. We can change this argument so that finishes the line with ^_^ instead:\n\n# notice we had always used print withough specifying any value for the `end` argument\nprint('I am changing the default end argument of the print function', end=' ^_^')\n\nI am changing the default end argument of the print function ^_^"

    "section": "1.7 Attributes & Methods",
    "text": "1.7 Attributes & Methods\nAn object in Python has attributes and methods. An attribute is a property of the object, some piece of information about it. A method is is a procedure associated with an object, so it is an action where the main ingredient is the object.\nFor example, these could be some attributes and methods a class cat:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nMore formally, a method is a function that acts on the object it is part of.\nWe can access a variable’s attributes and methods by adding a period . at the end of the variable’s name. So we would write variable.variable_method() or variable.variable_attribute.\nExample\nNumPy arrays have many methods and attributes. Let’s see some concrete examples.\n\n# define a 3x3 array\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [4, 5, 6],\n       [7, 8, 9]])\n\n\n\n# T is an example of attribute, it returns the transpose of var\nprint(var.T)\nprint(type(var.T))\n\n[[1 4 7]\n [2 5 8]\n [3 6 9]]\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n\n\n\n# shape, another attribute, tells us the array dimensions\nprint(var.shape)\nprint(type(var.shape))\n\n(3, 3)\n<class 'tuple'>\n\n\n\n# ndim is an attribute hilding the number of array dimensions.\nprint(var.ndim)\nprint(type(var.ndim))\n\n2\n<class 'int'>\n\n\nNotice these attributes can have many different data types. Here we saw tuples and int, two of the core Python classes, and also a numpy array as attributes of var.\nNow some examples of methods:\n\n# the tolist method returns the array as a nested list of scalars\nvar.tolist()\n\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\n\n\n# the min method returns the minimum value in the array along an axis\nvar.min(axis=0)\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-in\n\n\n\nWe can also call the min method without any parameters:\n\nvar.min()\n\n1\n\n\nWhat kind of parameter is axis in our previous call of the var method?\n\n\nRemember, methods are functions associated to an object. We can check this!\n\ntype(var.tolist)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\n\ntype(var.min)\n\nbuiltin_function_or_method\n\n\nYou can see a complete list of NumPy array’s methods and attributes in the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR and Python\n\n\n\nIn R we don’t use methods within an object. Rather, functions are extrinsic to (outside) the objects they are acting on. In R, for example, there would be two separate items: the variable var and a separate function min that gets var as a parameter:\n# this is R code\nvar <- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nmin(var)\nUsing the pipe operator % in R’s tidyverse is closer to the dot . in Python:\n# this is R code\nvar <- array(c(1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9), dim =c(3,3))\nvar % min()\nWhat happens here is that the pipe % is passing var to the min() function as its first argument. This is essentially what happens in Python when a function is a method of a class:\n# this is Python code\nvar = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nvar.min()\nWhen working in Python, remember that methods are functions that are part of an object and a method uses the object it is part of to produce some information."

    "text": "2.3 Series\nThe first core data structure of pandas is the series. A series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. A pandas.Series having an index is the main difference between a pandas.Series and a numpy array. See the difference:\n\n# a numpy array\n# np.random.randn returns values from the std normal distribution\narr = np.random.randn(4) \nprint(type(arr))\nprint(arr, \"\\n\")\n\n# a pandas series made from the previous array\ns = pd.Series(arr)\nprint(type(s))\nprint(s)\n\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n[ 0.26255995 -0.43578912  2.45025948  1.46437431] \n\n<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n0    0.262560\n1   -0.435789\n2    2.450259\n3    1.464374\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n2.3.1 How to create a pandas.Series\nThe basic method to create a pandas.Series is to call\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\nThe data parameter can be:\n\na numpy array or a list\na Python dictionary\na number\n\nThe index parameter is a list of index labels.\n\n2.3.1.1 From a numpy array or list\nTo use this method we need to pass a numpy array (or a list of objects that can be converted to NumPy types) as data and a list of indices of the same length as data.\n\n# a Series from a numpy array \npd.Series(np.arange(3), index=['a','b','c'])\n\na    0\nb    1\nc    2\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThe index parameter is optional. If we don’t include it, the default is to make the index equal to [0,...,len(data)-1]. For example:\n\n# a Series from a list of strings with default index\npd.Series(['EDS 220', 'EDS 222', 'EDS 223', 'EDS 242'])\n\n0    EDS 220\n1    EDS 222\n2    EDS 223\n3    EDS 242\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.2 From a dictionary\nRemember a dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. If we create a pandas.Series via a dictionary the keys will become the index and the values the corresponding data.\n\n# construct dictionary\nd = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}\n\n# initialize a sries using a dictionary\npd.Series(d)\n\na    0\nb    1\nc    2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1.3 From a number\nIf we only provide a number as the data for the series, we need to provide an index. The number will be repeated to match the length of the index.\n\npd.Series(3.0, index = ['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\nA    3.0\nB    3.0\nC    3.0\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Arithmetic operations\nArithmetic operations work on series and also most NumPy functions. For example:\n\n# define a series\ns = pd.Series([98,73,65],index=['Andrea', 'Beth', 'Carolina'])\n\n# divide each element in series by 10\nprint(s /10, '\\n')\n\n# take the exponential of each element in series\nprint(np.exp(s), '\\n')\n\n# notice this doesn't change the values of our series\nprint(s)\n\nAndrea      9.8\nBeth        7.3\nCarolina    6.5\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      3.637971e+42\nBeth        5.052394e+31\nCarolina    1.694889e+28\ndtype: float64 \n\nAndrea      98\nBeth        73\nCarolina    65\ndtype: int64\n\n\nThere’s much more to say about pandas.Series, but this is enought to get us going. Mainly, we want to know about pandas.Series because they will be the columns of our pandas.DataFrame.\n\n\n2.3.3 Attributes & Methods\npandas.Series have many attributes and methods, you can see a full list in the pandas documentation. For now we will cover two examples that have to do with identifying missing values.\npandas represents a missing or NA value with NaN, which stands for not a number. Sometime"

Each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series.\n\n2.4.1 Creating a pandas.DataFrame\nThere are many ways of creating a pandas.DataFrame. Although we likely won’t be creating data frames from scratch often, I’d like to go over creating a pandas.DataFrame from a dict of pandas.Series as this will help us understand the syntax for other Data Frame methods.\nWe already mentioned each column of a pandas.DataFrame is a pandas.Series. In fact, the pandas.DataFrame is a dictionary of pandas.Series, with each column name being the key and the column values being the key’s value. Thus, we can create a pandas.DataFrame in this way:\n\n# initialize dictionary with columns' data \nd = {'col_name_1' : pd.Series(np.arange(3)),\n     'col_name_2' : pd.Series([3.1, 3.2, 3.3]),\n     }\n\n# create data frame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      col_name_1\n      col_name_2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0\n      3.1\n    \n    \n      1\n      1\n      3.2\n    \n    \n      2\n      2\n      3.3\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can change the index and column names by changing the index and columns attributes in the data frame.\n\n# print original index\nprint(df.index)\n\n# change the index\ndf.index = ['a','b','c']\ndf\n\nRangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      col_name_1\n      col_name_2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      a\n      0\n      3.1\n    \n    \n      b\n      1\n      3.2\n    \n    \n      c\n      2\n      3.3\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# print original column names\nprint(df.columns)\n\n# change column names \ndf.columns = ['C1','C2']\ndf\n\nIndex(['col_name_1', 'col_name_2'], dtype='object')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      C1\n      C2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      a\n      0\n      3.1\n    \n    \n      b\n      1\n      3.2\n    \n    \n      c\n      2\n      3.3"

The column descriptions are:\n\nyear: ​calendar year\neurope - antarctica: ​change in glacial volume (km3​ ​) in each region that year\nglobal_glacial_volume_change: ​cumulative​ global glacial volume change (km3), starting in 1961\nannual_sea_level_rise: ​annual rise in sea level (mm)\ncumulative_sea_level_rise:​ cumulative rise in sea level (mm) since 1961\n\nFirst, we read-in the file and get some baisc information about this data frame:\n\n# read in file\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/lesson-1/glacial_loss.csv')\n\n# see the first five rows\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      year\n      europe\n      arctic\n      alaska\n      asia\n      north_america\n      south_america\n      antarctica\n      global_glacial_volume_change\n      annual_sea_level_rise\n      cumulative_sea_level_rise\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1961\n      -5.128903\n      -108.382987\n      -18.721190\n      -32.350759\n      -14.359007\n      -4.739367\n      -35.116389\n      -220.823515\n      0.610010\n      0.610010\n    \n    \n      1\n      1962\n      5.576282\n      -173.252450\n      -24.324790\n      -4.675440\n      -2.161842\n      -13.694367\n      -78.222887\n      -514.269862\n      0.810625\n      1.420635\n    \n    \n      2\n      1963\n      -10.123105\n      -0.423751\n      -2.047567\n      -3.027298\n      -27.535881\n      3.419633\n      3.765109\n      -550.575640\n      0.100292\n      1.520927\n    \n    \n      3\n      1964\n      -4.508358\n      20.070148\n      0.477800\n      -18.675385\n      -2.248286\n      20.732633\n      14.853096\n      -519.589859\n      -0.085596\n      1.435331\n    \n    \n      4\n      1965\n      10.629385\n      43.695389\n      -0.115332\n      -18.414602\n      -19.398765\n      6.862102\n      22.793484\n      -473.112003\n      -0.128392\n      1.306939\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n# get column names\ndf.columns\n\nIndex(['year', 'europe', 'arctic', 'alaska', 'asia', 'north_america',\n       'south_america', 'antarctica', 'global_glacial_volume_change',\n       'annual_sea_level_rise', 'cumulative_sea_level_rise'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n# data frame's shape: output is a tuple (# rows, # columns)\ndf.shape\n\n(43, 11)\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Selecting a single column…\n\n2.5.1.1 …by label\nThis is the simplest case for selecting data. Suppose we are interested in the annual sea level rise. Then we can access that single column in this way:\n\n# seelect a single column by using square brackets []\nannual_rise = df['annual_sea_level_rise']\n\n# check the type of the ouput\nprint(type(annual_rise))\n\nannual_rise.head()\n\n<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\n\n\n0    0.610010\n1    0.810625\n2    0.100292\n3   -0.085596\n4   -0.128392\nName: annual_sea_level_rise, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince we only selected a single column the output is a pandas.Series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.DataFrame = dictionary of columns\n\n\n\nRemember we can think of a pandas.DataFrame as a dictionary of its columns? Then we can access a single column using the column name as the key, just like we would do in a dictionary. That is the syntaxi we just used: df['column_name'].\n\n\nIn general, selecting by label means we want to select data from our data frame using the names of the columns, not their position.\n\n\n2.5.1.2 … with attribute syntax\nWe can also access a single column by using attribute syntax:\n\nannual_rise_2 = df.annual_sea_level_rise\nannual_rise_2.head()\n\n0    0.610010\n1    0.810625\n2    0.100292\n3   -0.085596\n4   -0.128392\nName: annual_sea_level_rise, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Selecting multiple columns…\n\n2.5.2.1 … using a list of column names\nThis is another example of selecting by labels. We just need to pass a list with the column names to the square brackets []. For example, say we want to look at the change in glacial volume in Europe and Asia, then we can select those columns like this:\n\n# select columns with names \"europe\" and \"asia\"\neurope_asia = df[['europe','asia']]\n\nNotice there are double square brackets. This is because we are passing the list of names ['europe','asia'] to the selection brakcets [].\n\n# check the type of the resulting selection\nprint(type(europe_asia))\n\n# check the shape of the selection\nprint((europe_asia.shape))\n\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n(43, 2)\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2.2 … using a slice\nYet another example of label selection! In this case we will use the loc function. This is a powerful function! The general syntax is\ndf.loc[ row-selection , column-selection]\nwhere row-selection and column-selection are the rows and columns we want to subset from the data frame.\nLet’s start by a simple example, where we want to select a slice of columns, say the change in glacial volume per year in all regions. This corresponds to all columns between arctic and antarctica.\n\n# select all columns between 'arctic' and 'antarctica'\nall_regions = df.loc[:,'arctic':'antarctica']\nall_regions.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      arctic\n      alaska\n      asia\n      north_america\n      south_america\n      antarctica\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      -108.382987\n      -18.721190\n      -32.350759\n      -14.359007\n      -4.739367\n      -35.116389\n    \n    \n      1\n      -173.252450\n      -24.324790\n      -4.675440\n      -2.161842\n      -13.694367\n      -78.222887\n    \n    \n      2\n      -0.423751\n      -2.047567\n      -3.027298\n      -27.535881\n      3.419633\n      3.765109\n    \n    \n      3\n      20.070148\n      0.477800\n      -18.675385\n      -2.248286\n      20.732633\n      14.853096\n    \n    \n      4\n      43.695389\n      -0.115332\n      -18.414602\n      -19.398765\n      6.862102\n      22.793484\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNotice two things:\n\nwe used the colon : as the row-selection parameters, this means “select all the rows”\nthe slice of the data frame we got includes both endpoints of the slice 'arctic':'antarctica'. In other words we get the arctic column and the antarctica column. This is different from how slicing works in base Python and NumPy, where the end point is not included.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Selecting rows…\n\n2.5.3.1 … using a condition\n\n\n2.5.3.2 … by position\n\n\n\n\n\n\niloc vs. loc\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the difference between iloc and loc can be confusing. Remember the i in iloc stands for integer-location, so this function only uses integer indexing to retrieve information from the data frames. Moreover, remember iloc indexing works in the same way as indexing for Python lists.\nIf you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between iloc and loc: Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting a column with iloc? Avoid it!\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to access the 10th column in the data frame - then we want to select a column by position. In this case the 10th column is the annual sea level rise data and the 10th position corresponds to the index 9. We can select this column by position using the iloc method*:\n\n# select column by position using iloc\n# the syntax is iloc[rows,columns]\n# [:,9] means \"select all rows from the 10th column\"\nannual_rise_3 = df.iloc[:,9]\nannual_rise_3.head()\n\n0    0.610010\n1    0.810625\n2    0.100292\n3   -0.085596\n4   -0.128392\nName: annual_sea_level_rise, dtype: float64\n\n\nUnless you are really looking for information about the 10th column, do not access a column by position. This is bound to break in many ways:\n\nit relies on a person correctly counting the position of a column. Even with a small dataset this can be prone to error.\nit is not explicit: if we wnat information about sea level rise df.annual_sea_level_rise or df['annual_sea_level_rise'] are explicitely telling us we are accessing that information. df.iloc[:,9] is obscure and uninformative.\ndatastets can get updated. Maybe a new column was added before annual_sea_level_rise, this would change the position of the column, which would make any code depnding on df.iloc[:,9] invalid. Accessing by label helps reproducibility!\n\n\n\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of methods to select data, there are so many ways to subset the same data and it can get quite fancy. For a simple take on some of these concepts, the pandas Getting started tutorials - How do I select a subset of a DataFrame is a good reference."
