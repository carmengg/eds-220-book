# Discussion Section 1

Date: October 6, 2023.

Fork and clone a repository for this lab?

## Exercise 1
Consider the following code:


```{python}
import numpy as np

?np.ones
```
![](/images/lesson-1/np-ones-docstring.png)

```{python}
abc = np.ones([3,2], dtype=np.int8)
print(abc)

x = abc.mean()
print(x)
```

Complete the following paragraph using the given words:

| . | . | .| .|
|---|---|---|---|
| class | function | object |method |
| variable | non-default |data-type |default |
|package | attribute | outout | parameter(s) | optional|

`abc` is a ________ assigned to the NumPy ________ `np.ones([3,2])`. We construct `np.ones([3,2])` by calling a ________ from the NumPy ________. `[3,2]` and `np.int8` are ________ we pass to the `np.ones` ________. `np.int8` is a ________ parameter of `np.ones`. `abc.mean` is an ________ of `abc` and `x` is its ________.

## GitHub Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub. Use the following settings:

    a. Call the repository 'eds-220-section-1'.

    b. Add a brief description for your new repository. For example: EDS 220 section - practice session for data selection in pandas.

    c. Keep the repository public.

    d. Initialize the repository with a `README` file and a Python .gitignore template.

2. Clone the repository to a new directory in the Taylor server under your eds-220 directory.

3. In the terminal use `cd` to navigate into the 'eds-220-section-1' directory. Use `pwd` to verify this is your current working directory.

3. Create a new Python Notebook in the 'eds-220-section-1' directory. 

4. Update the notebook's name to something useful like 'exercise-data-selection.qmd'.

5. Use the terminal to stage, commit, and push this file to the remote repository (on GitHub). Remember:
    - to stage: `git add FILE_NAME`
    - to commit with message: `git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"`
    - to push: `git push`

6. If you are prompted for your credentials and need to set up a new Personal Access Token (PAT) follow [steps 13-18 in this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pk6_rUDdFjdGg-YVo9Cl8ET3iDsYahyaP0VMRD4UHUk/edit?usp=sharing/) to set it up.

## About the data

For this exercise we are going to use data about  [Western Indian Ocean Coral Diversity](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1K35S3H).

This dataset is stored in the [Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB)](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org) data repository. This is an international repository intended to facilitate ecological and environmental research. It has thousands of open datasets and it's hosted by NCEAS!

 Navigate to dataset's link and briefly explore the data package.
:::

0. Be sure to comment your code throughout this exercise!

1. Import the pandas package using standard abbreviation in a code cell.

2. Use the `pandas.read_csv()` function to read in the csv file in the Coral Diversity data by following these steps:

    a. Create a new code cell under the “Read and explore data” header.

    b. Navigate to the [data package site](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1K35S3H) and copy the the URL to access the `WesternIndianOceanCoralDiversity` csv file. To copy the URL: hover over the Download button –> right click –> “Copy Link".

    c. Read in the data from the URL using the `pd.read_csv` function and store it as `coral_div`:

    ```python
    # read in data
    coral_div = pd.read_csv('the URL goes here')
    ```

    d. Use attributes and methods of the `coral_div` data frame to obtain the following information about it:
        - how many rows and columns does it have?
        - see the first 5 rows
        - what are its column names?
        - what are the data types of the columns?
    
        In this last step, what is the difference between the `int64` and `float64` data types?

    e. In which countries was this data collected? HINT: the `Country` column indicates the country of reef location. 

    f. How many observers collected this data? HINT: use the `len` Python function. Not sure what it is? Use `?`.

    g. 

    

```{python}
import pandas as pd

coral_div = pd.read_csv('https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Ae7d12a5a-f1a9-4a3e-aaa5-5222f67e799d')
```

```{python}
coral_div.shape
``` 

```{python}
coral_div.head()
```

```{python}
coral_div.columns
```

```{python}
coral_div.dtypes
```

```{python}
coral_div.Country.unique()
```

```{python}
len(coral_div.Observer.unique())
```
