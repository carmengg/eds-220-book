# *Lab: STAC access

The goal of this lab is to practice retrieving data from a STAC catalog and extracting information from STAC item's assets.

## Notebook Setup
1. You will be working either in the Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC) or locally in VSCode with the environment we created yesterday.

2. Clone your `eds-220-sections` directory to your chose platform.

2. Create a new notebook in your `eds-220-sections` directory. Update the name to 'modis-ndvi.ipynb'.

3. Use the terminal to stage, commit, and push this file to the remote repository.

## About the data

I this task we will use data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices 16-Day Version. 
This dataset has NDVI calculations at 500m spatial resolution globally and is part of the MPC STAC catalog. 

Read the [catalog's overview](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/modis-13A1-061#overview) before starting the exercise.

## Data access

1. Open the MPC STAC catalog.
2. Create a search for data in the MODIS Vegetation Indices dataset (id = `'modis-13A1-061'`) from 2023 that intersects the box bounds: 

[-119.28376473993174, 35.561681976121605, -117.15965333370627, 36.65291223580975]

This list of coordinates is in the form `[minx, miny, maxx, maxy]` with epsg:4326 and describes a square around Sequoia National Park. 
 
HINT: You can use the list directly in the catalog search without converting it to a JSon format. 

3. How many items are in the search?

## Examine Dates

 1. Select the first item in the search as a variable `item`.

 2. Run `item.properties`. What kind of Python data structure is this? You can also check it using `type`. 

 3. Use the `'datetime'`, `'start_datetime'`, and `'end_datetime'` [keys](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/) to print the datetime information of the item. 

 4. The `'datetime'` value usually refers to the date of collection. Discuss with your team: why does this item does not have a datetime, but instead has start and end times? HINT: [read the datset's overview](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/modis-13A1-061#overview).
