# *Lab: Maps

:::{.callout-tip}
## Notebook Setup
1. In the Taylor server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.

2. In the directory navigation bar, open the `eds-220-sections` directory you created in the last lab.

4. In the terminal, navigate into the `eds-220-sections` directory and verify `eds-220-sections` is your current working directory.

5. Create a new Python Notebook in `eds-220-sections`. 

6. Update the notebook's name to something useful like 'exercise-earthquake-data.ipynb'.

7. Use the terminal to stage, commit, and push this file to the remote repository. 

8. If you are prompted for your credentials and need to set up a new Personal Access Token (PAT) follow [steps 13-18 in this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pk6_rUDdFjdGg-YVo9Cl8ET3iDsYahyaP0VMRD4UHUk/edit?usp=sharing/) to set it up.

## About the data

For this task we are going to use simplified data from the [USGS Earthquakes Database](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). 
This is the same dataset we used for homework 1 - task 4. 
It is in tabular format and has the following columns.

time = date and time of event (all events from 2014)
latitude = decimal degrees [-90,90]
longitude = decimal degrees [-360,360]
depth = depth of the event (km)
mag = magnitude of event
id = event identifier
place = where the event took place
type = type of event

Further information about the dataset can be accessed in the [ANSS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (ComCat) Documentation](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/).
