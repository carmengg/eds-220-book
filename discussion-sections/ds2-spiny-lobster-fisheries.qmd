# Basic Time Series

October X, 2023.

<!-- include description and goals -->

:::{.callout-tip}
## Notebook Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub. Use the following settings:

    a. Call the repository `eds-220-sections`. We'll try reusing this same repository for all upcoming sections.

    b. Add a brief description for your new repository. For example: EDS 220 sections - practice sessions for environmental data analysis.

    c. Keep the repository public.

    d. Initialize the repository with a `README` file and a Python .gitignore template.

2. Add your repository's URL and your GitHub username to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPEIU0PSHs90cwD_RiIhY6swEBSMR-6MmTmM_toykvM/edit?usp=sharing). Names or ordered alphabetically by surname. We won't grade these, it's just for keeping track. 

3. In the Taylor server, start a new JupyterLab session or access an active one.

4. Using the terminal, clone the repository to a new directory under your `eds-220` directory.

5. In the terminal, navigate into the `eds-220-sections` directory and verify `eds-220-sections` is your current working directory.

6. Create a new Python Notebook in `eds-220-sections`. 

7. Update the notebook's name to something useful like 'exercise-lobster-data.ipynb'.

8. Use the terminal to stage, commit, and push this file to the remote repository. Remember:
    - stage: `git add FILE_NAME`
    - commit with message: `git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"`
    - push: `git push`

9. If you are prompted for your credentials and need to set up a new Personal Access Token (PAT) follow [steps 13-18 in this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pk6_rUDdFjdGg-YVo9Cl8ET3iDsYahyaP0VMRD4UHUk/edit?usp=sharing/) to set it up.

## General directions
- Add comments in each one of your code cells 
- Include markdown cells in between your code cells to add titles/information to each exercise
- Indications about when to commit and push changes are included, but you are welcome to commit and push more often. 
- You won't need to upload any data

## About the data

For this exercise we will use data about [California spiny lobster (*Panuliris interruptus*) in the Santa Barbara Channel (Lenihan, 2021)](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.148.1). 

This dataset is stored in the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://edirepository.org) data repository. This is a huge data repository committed to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 
:::

<!-- Data exploration -->
## Archive exploration
Take some time to look through the dataset's description in EDI and click around. Discuss the following questions with your team:

a. What is this data about?
b. During what time frame were the observations in the dataset collected?
c. Does the dataset contain sensitive data?
d. Is there a publication associated with this dataset?

In your notebook: use a markdown cell to add a brief description of the dataset, including a citation, date of access, and a link to the archive. 

## Add a lobster picture
Follow these steps to add a lobster image using a URL:

a. Go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_lobster#/media/File:California_spiny_lobster.JPG

b. Get the URL of the lobster image. To do this:

- hover over the Download button –> right click –> “Copy Image Address".

c. At the end of the markdown cell with the dataset description, use markdown sytanx to add the image from its URL:
`![image description ](URL-goes-here)`

d. In the image description add picture by M. Kjærgaard for appropriate attribution.

## metadata exploration
Click on *View Full Metadata* to access more information. Take a minute to look at the descriptions for the columns.  

<!-- Data loading -->
## Data loading

Back in your notebook, import the `pandas` package in a code cell and import the `` from its URL using the `pandas.read_csv()` function.


```python
# read in data
prey = pd.read_csv('the URL goes here')
```

**check git status -> stage changes -> check git status -> commit with message -> push  changes**
