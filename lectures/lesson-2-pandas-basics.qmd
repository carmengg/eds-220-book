# Pandas Fundamentals

## About
In this lesson we will cover the two core objects in the pandas library the series and the data frame. We will also learn methods to subset, select, and add data to our data frames, as well as some basic plotting with matplotlib.

There is so much about pandas. While we won't be able to cover every single functionality of this package in the next three lecutres, the goal is to get you started with the basic tools for tabular data analysis and give you a solid basis on which you can explore further. 

## `pandas`

`pandas` is a Python package to wrangle and analyze tabular data. It is built on top of NumPy and has become the core tool for doing data analysis in Python. 

The convention to import it is:

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# we will also import numpy 
import numpy as np
```

## Series

The first core data structure of pandas is the **series**. 
A series is *one-dimensional* array of *indexed* data. A `pandas.Series` having an **index** is the main difference between a `pandas.Series` and a numpy array. 

**Example 1**
```{python}
# a numpy array
arr = np.random.randn(5) #np.random.randn returns values from the std normal distribution
print(type(arr))
print(arr, "\n")

# a pandas series
s = pd.Series(arr)
print(type(s))
print(s)
```


### How to create a `pandas.Series`

The basic method to create a `pandas.Series` is to call

``` python
s = pd.Series(data, index=index)
```

The `data` parameter can be:

- a [numpy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html) or [a list](https://realpython.com/python-list/)
- a [Python dictionary](https://realpython.com/lessons/dictionary-python/)
- [a number](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Number-three.JPG)

The `index` parameter is a list of index labels.

#### From a numpy array or list

To use this method we need to pass a numpy array (or any list of objects) as `data` and a list of indices of the same length as data. 

```{python}
# a Series from a numpy array 
pd.Series(np.arange(3), index=['a','b','c'])
```


 The `index` parameter is optional. If we don't include it the default is to make the index be `[0,...,len(data)-1]` (see Example 1).

```{python}
# a Series from a list of strings with default index
pd.Series(['EDS 220', 'EDS 222', 'EDS 223', 'EDS 242'])
```


#### From a dictionary

Remember a dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. If we create a `pandas.Series` via a dictionary the keys will become the index and the values the corresponding data.

```{python}
# construct dictionary
d = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}

# initialize a sries using a dictionary
pd.Series(d)
```

#### From a number
If we only provide a number as the data for the series, we need to provide an index. The number will be repeated to math the length of the index.

```{python}
pd.Series(3.0, index = ['A', 'B', 'C'])
```


### Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations work on series and also most NumPy functions. For example:

```{python}
# define a series
s = pd.Series([98,73,65],index=['Andrea', 'Beth', 'Carolina'])

# divide each element in series by 10
print(s /10, '\n')

# take the exponential of each element in series
print(np.exp(s), '\n')

# notice this doesn't change the values of our object
print(s)

```

There's much more to say about `pandas.Series`, but this is enought to get us going. Mainly, we want to know about `pandas.Series` because they will be the columns of our `pandas.DataFrame`.

### Indexing

#### By label...

Indexing by label means we want to select data from our series using the label names in the series' index. There are two ways of indexing by label:

##### ... with `[]`

We can use `[]` to acess specific values by label in the same way as we do in a dictionary: `series['index_label']`

```{python}
# initalize series
s = pd.Series(np.arange(5), index=['a','b','c','d','e'])
print(s, '\n')

# access element corresponding to label 'b'
s['b']
```

##### ... with `loc`
This will be our preferred method in the course. We can do a many things with it:

```{python}
# access a specific element by label
s.loc['b']
```
```{python}
# access a few elements by label
s.loc[['a','c','e']]
```

```{python}
# select based on True/False values
s.loc[s>3]
```

```{python}
# slice the series using the labels
s.loc['b':'d']
```

## slicing with `loc`
Notice that when use slicing with `loc` we get both the start *and the end* of the indices we indicated. This is different to slicing in numpy arrays or lists where we do not get the element at the end of the slice. Compare the following:

```{python}
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(x)

# slicing will return elements at indices 2 trhough 4 (inclusive)
x[2:5]
```

```{python}
# define a np array with integers from 0 to 9
y = np.arange(10)
print(y)

# slicing will return elements at indices 2 trhough 4 (inclusive)
y[2:5]
```

```{python}
 z = pd.Series(y)
 print(z)

# slicing will return elements with index labels 2 through 5 (inclusive)
 z.loc[2:5]
```
::: 

#### By position
Indexing by position means we want to select data from our series based on where it is within the series. 

We can access a value by position using the `iloc` method. `iloc` stands for *integer-location based indexing*. This is the same kind of indexing we do in 1-dimensional numpy arrays or lists, where we use integers to access elements in the array and the index starts from 0.


```{python}
# initialize series
s = pd.Series(np.arange(10,13), index=['a','b','c'])
print(s, '\n')

# access element at index 2 (third element in series)
s.iloc[2]
```


If we try to use `iloc` with a label from our index we will get an error. Notice the TypeError: *Cannot index by location with a non-integer key*.

::: {.callout-caution}
## `iloc` vs. `loc`
At the beginning the difference between `iloc` and `loc` can be confusing. Remember the `i` in `iloc` stands for integer-location, so this function only uses integers to retrieve information from the series. Moreover, remember `iloc` indexing works in the same way as indexing for Python lists.

If you want to dive deeper, this is a great discussion about the difference between `iloc` and `loc`: [Stackoverflow - How are iloc and loc different?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31593201/how-are-iloc-and-loc-different/31593712#31593712)
