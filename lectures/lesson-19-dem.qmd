# Raster manipulation I

In this lesson we will learn how to perform some global and local operations on our raster. 
We will also go over customizations for plotting raster data and review the Python for loop.

## Data
<!-- https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Grand_Canyon_National_Park_06.jpg-->

We will use data from the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
This dataset ris based on radar satellite data measuring the relative height of Earth's surface. 
The Copernicus DEM is available at 30-meter and 90-meter resolution.
The data prepared for this class is a tile of 1°x1° latitude/longitude form the Copernicus DEM at 90-meter resolution over the Grand Canyon in the US. 
Each pixel represents vertical units measured in meters. 
The data was accessed via the [Microsoft’s Planetary Computer Copernicus DEM GLO-30 data repository](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/cop-dem-glo-30#overview)

Click here to access the [Copernicus DEM complete product Handbook](https://object.cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/Copernicus_metadata.pdf).

<!--
To create a simple map for context we will also use a file with the boundaries of the US National Parks boundaries, provided by the US National Park Service [](https://public-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nps::nps-boundary-4/about).
-->

## Import data
Let’s start by loading the libraries we’ll use:

```{python}
import os
import numpy as np

import geopandas as gpd
import xarray as xr
import rioxarray as rioxr

from shapely import Point
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

::: {.callout-tip}
# Exercise
1. Use `os` to createa file path to the 'grand_canyon_DEM.tif' file and import the raster into a variable called `gc`.
2. Plot the raster, check the CRS, and create a histogram with updated bin numbers.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Solution
Loading our dataset:
```{python}
# load Grand Canyon DEM data
data_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'data','grand_canyon_DEM.tif')
gc = rioxr.open_rasterio(data_path)
gc
```

A brief exploration of our dataset:
```{python}
# exploratory plot
gc.plot()
```

Getting the coordinate reference system (CRS):
```{python}
# check the raster's CRS
gc.rio.crs
```

Check distribution of elevation values:
```{python}
# plot histogram of elevation values
# get bin values output on "disposable" variable _ 
_ = gc.plot.hist(bins=50)
```

::: {.callout-note}
# `_`
Notice in the previous line of code we used the underscore `_` to capture the output of the histogram. 
The underscore `_` is often used in Python to name a "disposable" variable we will not use in the future.

## Geographic context

To have a better sense of where our raster data is, let's plot one map showing the (general) location of the tile in the world and another one showing the bounding box over the Grand Canyon National Park boundary.

```{python}
# get the bounds for our raster
bounds = gc.rio.bounds()
bounds
```

### World map + aoi
To show the location of our area of interest (aoi) in the world we will:
1. load the Natural Earth low-resolution world dataset available through `geopandas`
2. construct a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` with a single point in it using the `xmin` and `ymin` form the raster's bounds and the raster's crs.
3. plot the point on top of the worldmap. 

```{python}
# load Natural Earth worldmap
worldmap = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path("naturalearth_lowres"))

grand_canyon = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry = [Point([bounds[0],bounds[1]])], crs=gc.rio.crs)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.axis('off')
worldmap.plot(ax=ax, color = 'lightgray')
grand_canyon.plot(ax=ax, marker='*', color='red')
plt.show()
```

You can check the different types of markers available for points in the [`matplolib` documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html).

## Dropping a dimension: `squeeze()` and `drop()`

Notice that our raster has an unnecessary extra dimension: band.

```{python}
gc
```

This is making this datsets three-dimensional when it is not needed. 
We can clean this `xarray.DataArray` a bit by:

1. using the [`squeeze()` method](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.squeeze.html).
If we don't pass any parameters, then `squeeze()` gets rid of all dimensions with length one, and then

2. getting rid of the associated coordinates for this dimension. 
We can do this using the `xarray.DataArray` `drop()` method and specifying the name of the coordinates we want to remove, in this case 'band'.

Let's do this:
```{python}
# original dimensions and coordinates
print(gc.dims, gc.coords,'\n')

# remove length 1 dimension (band)
gc = gc.squeeze()
print(gc.dims, gc.coords,'\n')

# remove coordinates associated to band
gc = gc.drop('band')
print(gc.dims, gc.coords)
```

## Global information

To get a better sense of our raster data we can apply common `numpy` functions to extract information from the `xarray.DataArray` underlying `np.array`.

For example, we can get the maximum across all the `xarray.DataArray`'s values by using the `max()` method:
```{python}
# get the maximum elevation value (get an xarray.DataArray)
gc.max()
```

Notice that the output for this method is another `xarray.DataArray`. 
In general, methods that reduce or subset an `xarray.DataArray` will always return another `xarray.DataArray`. 
To extract the value from a 1x1 `xarray.DataArray` as a number we use the [`.item()` method](#https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.item.html):

```{python}
# get the maximum elevation value as a number
gc.max().item()
```

## f-strings

So far we have printed variables using string concatenation inside the `print()` function. 
This means that we write commas between every string and variable we want to print, and then the print function concatenates these into a single string. For example:

```{python}
# minimum elevation
# print via concatenation
print("Minimum elevation: ", gc.min().item())
```

Another popular way of mixing strings and variables in print statements is by creating an **f-string** which stands for "formatted string". 
The simplest syntax for an f-string is:
```python
f" some text {replace}"
```
where `replace` can be a variable, an expression, or a function or method call. 
For example:

```{python}
# f-string with mean elevation
f"Mean elevation: {gc.mean().item()}"
```

We just created a string replacing the value inside the curly brackets `{}`. 
Notice the computation is occurring in real time as the string gets made and there's no need to define any extra variables.

One of the advantages of using f-strings is that they offer customization for formatting the output, without the need to use extra functions. 
For example, if we want to print the median value of our raster rounded to two decimals we can do:

```{python}
# median elevation, rounded to two decimals
# print via f-string formatting
print(f"Median elevation: {gc.median().item():.2f}")
```

Some extra resources about using f-string formatting:

- [Python documentation- Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec)


## Aggregation: `coarsen()`

Let's go back to our raster. 
Rasters with high spatial resolution can offer great insight into fine-scale patterns, but can also be challenging to process due to their size. 
In these cases, it can be useful to use an **aggregation method** to **spatially downsample** and obtain a raster with a coarser resolution. 

To spatially downsample an `xarray.DataArray` we use the [`coarsen()` method](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/v2023.10.1/generated/xarray.DataArray.coarsen.html) followed by an aggreagator function. 
The general syntax to coarsen a 2-dimensional :
```python
xdataarray.coarsen(x=x_winside, y=y_winside).aggr()
```
where:

- `xdataarray` is a 2-dimensional `xarray.DataArray` with dimensions `x` and `y`. 
- `x` and `y` are the names dimensions of the `xarray.DataArray` (these could have other names like `lon`/`lat`)
- `x_winside` and `y_winside` are the dimensions of the window used to make the aggregation. 
- `aggr()` is an aggregator function, this is the function which will be applied to each window. Examples are `min()`, `max()`, `sum()` and `mean()`.

**Example**

Suppose we want to coarsen our Grand Canyon elevation raster from 1200x1200 pixels to a raster of 60x60 pixels where by calculating the maximun at each window. 
Remember the windows are non-overlapping, so we will obtain one pixel per window. 
A quick division tells us that to got from 1200x1200 to 60x60 we will need to use a 20x20 window. 
The aggregator function on each of this window will be `max()`.
Our call looks like this:

```{python}
# coarsen to a 60x60 raster calculating the maximum value in each window
gc_coarse = gc.coarsen(x=20,y=20).max()
gc_coarse
```

```{python}
# inspect old and coarsened resolution
print(f"old resolution: {gc.rio.width}x{gc.rio.height}")
print(f"coarse resolution: {gc_coarse.rio.width}x{gc_coarse.rio.height}")
gc_coarse.plot()
```

::: {.callout-tip}
# Exercise
Downsample the elevation raster into a 240x240 raster by taking the average over windows of the appropriate size. 

Use an f-string to check whether the spatial bounds of the rasters have changed.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Solution

Decrese resolution:
```{python}
# coarsen to a 240x240 raster calculating the mean in each window
gc_coarse_mean = gc.coarsen(x=5,y=5).mean()
gc_coarse_mean
```

```{python}
gc_coarse_mean.plot()
```

Check spatial bounds:

```{python}
print(f"old spatial bounds: {gc.rio.bounds()}")
print(f"coarse resolution: {gc_coarse_mean.rio.bounds}")
gc_coarse_mean.plot()
```
