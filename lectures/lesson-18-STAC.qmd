# STAC specification

So far in our course we have accessed data in two ways: by downloading it directly from the data provider or by loading a specific dataset via a URL. 
This can be a convenient way to access targeted datasets, often usign GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for data discovery and filtering.
However, relying on clicking and copy-pasting addresses and file names can make our workflows more error-prone and less reproducible. 
In particular, satellites around the world produce terabytes of new data daily and manually browsing through data repositories would it make hard to access this data. 
Moreover, we wouldn't want to learn a new way to access data from every single big data provider.
This is where STAC comes in.

The **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)** is an emerging open standard for geospatial data that aims to increase the interoperability of geospatial data, particularly satellite imagery. 
Major satellite imagery datasets like X, Y, and [many others](https://stacspec.org/en/about/datasets/), now follow the STAC specification.

In the next classes we'll be working with the [Microsoft's Planetary Computer (MPC)](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com) STAC API. 
The MPC is both a geospatial coding environment and a STAC data catalogue. 
In this lesson we will learn about the main components of a STAC catalog and how to search for data using the MPC's STAC API. 

## Item, Collection, and Catalog
The **STAC item** (or just item) is the building block of a STAC. 
An item is a GeoJSON feature with additional fields that make it easier to find the item as we look for data across catalogs. 

An item holds two types of information:

1. **Metadata:** The metadata for a STAC item includes core identifying information (such as id, geometry, bounding box, and date), and additional properties (for example, place of collection). 

2. **Assets:** Assets are the links to the actual data of the item (for example, links to the spectral bands of a satellite image.)

STAC items can be grouped into **STAC collections** (or just collections). 
For example, while a single satellite scene (at a single time and location) would constitue an item, scenes across time and location from the same satellite can be orgnanized in a collection. 
Finally, multiple collections can be organized into a single catalog. 

## API
To request data from a catalog following the STAC standard we use an **Application Programming Interface (API)**. 
We can think of an API as an intermediary tasked with sending our request for data to the data catalog and getting the response from the catalog back to us. 
The following is a nice real-life analogy:

![[Geeks for geeks - What is an API?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-api/)](/images/what-is-an-api.png)

The Python package to access APIs for STAC catalogs is [`pystac_client`](https://pystac-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 
Our goal in this lesson is to retrieve [NAIP data](https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com) from the [MPC's data catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog) via its STAC API. 
We'll be doing this within the MPC's hub.
