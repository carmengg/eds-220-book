# STAC specification

In the next classes we'll be working on [Microsoft's Planetary Computer (MPC)](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com). 
The MPC is both a geospatial coding environment and a data catalogue. 
In this lesson we will learn how to search for data using the MPC's STAC API. 

## STAC
So far in our course we have accessed data in two ways: by downloading it directly from the data provider or by loading a specific dataset via a URL. 
This can be a convenient way to access targeted datasets, often usign GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for data discovery and filtering.
However, relying on clicking and copy-pasting addresses and file names can make our workflows more error-prone and less reproducible. 
In particular, satellites around the world produce terabytes of new data daily and manually browsing through data repositories would it make hard to access this data. 
In this lesson we will access data using an API (Application Programming Interface)
