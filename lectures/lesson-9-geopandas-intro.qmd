# `geopandas`

GeoPandas is a Python library that extends the `pandas` library by adding support for geospatial data. In this lesson we will introduce the `geopandas` library to work with vector data. We will also make our first map. 

To begin with, let's import `geopandas` with its standard abbreviation `gpd`:

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
```

## Data

In this lesson we will use simplified point data about wild pigs (*Sus scrofa*) sightings in California county from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org). 

We can read in a shapefile with `geopandas` by using the `gpd.read_file()` function. 

```{python}
pigs = gpd.read_file('gbif_sus_scroga_california/gbif_sus_scroga_california.shp')
pigs.head()
```

::: {.callout-caution}
Although the parameter is only the `.shp` file, remember that we need to have at least the `.shx` and `.dbf` files in the same directory as the `.shp` to read in the data.

## `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame`

The core data structure in GeoPandas is the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`. 
We can think of it as a `pandas.DataFrame` with a dedicated geometry column that can perform spatial operations. 

The **geometry column** in a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` holds the geometry (point, polygon, etc) of each spatial feature. Columns in the `gpd.GeoDataFrame` with attributes about the features are `pandas.Series` like in a regular `pd.DataFrame`.

**Example**

First of all, notice that the leftmost column of `pigs` is a column named `geometry` whose values indicate points. 

```{python}
pigs.head(3)
```

As usual, we can check the type of our objects using the `type` Python function:

```{python}
# type of the pigs dataframe 
print(type(pigs))

# type of the geometry column
print(type(pigs.geometry))

# type of the gbifID column
print(type(pigs.gbifID))
```

We can also check the type of a single point in the geometry column:

```{python}
print(type(pigs.geometry[0]))
```

This is a `shapely` point. `shapely` is another Python library that to construct and modify points, lines, and polygons. We will talk more about it in the next lessons.
