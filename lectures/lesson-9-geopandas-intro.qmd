# `geopandas`

GeoPandas is a Python library that extends the `pandas` library by adding support for geospatial data. In this lesson we will introduce the `geopandas` library to work with vector data. We will also make our first map. 

To begin with, let's import `geopandas` with its standard abbreviation `gpd`:

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
```

## Data

In this lesson we will use  with point data about wild pigs (*Sus scrofa) sightings in Santa Barbara county from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org).

```{python}

```

## `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame`

The core data structure in GeoPandas is the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`. 
We can think of it as a `pandas.DataFrame` with a dedicated geometry column that can perform spatial operations. 

The **geometry column** in a `gpd.GeoDataFrame` holds the geometry (point, polygon, etc) of each spatial feature. Columns in the `gpd.GeoDataFrame` with attributes about the features are `pandas.Series` like in a regular `pd.DataFrame`.
