# Updating CRS

In this lesson we will learn how to change the CRS of a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` and how to make a CSV into a `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, setting its CRS manually. 

## Data
We will use two datasets in this lesson. 
The first one is a dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) with [information about operable electric generating plants in the United States by energy source, as of May 2023](https://atlas.eia.gov/datasets/eia::power-plants/about). 
Follow these steps to download the datset for this lesson:

1. Click on the "Download" button.
2. On the side panel click on "Download" for the csv format of the file.

You can [access the metadata for this dataset here](https://eia.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/bf5c5110b1b944d299bb683cdbd02d2a/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html). 

The second dataset is a [TIGER shapefile from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2022.html#list-tab-790442341). 
TIGER stands for [Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topologically_Integrated_Geographic_Encoding_and_Referencing). This used to be the data format the US Census distributed geospatial data, but since 2008 TIGER files are converted to shapefiles. 
We will use the shapefiles for the US states. 
Follow these steps to download shapefile with the United States' states:

1. At the bottom of the [2022 page](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2022.html#list-tab-790442341), under Download, click on "Web Interface"
2. For year, select 2022, and for layer type select "States (and equivalent)". Click submit. 
3. Click on "Download national file".

**Move both datasets to your working directory, inside a directory named "data".**

## Libraries

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries:

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/dev/api/crs/crs.html
from pyproj.crs import CRS
```

This is our first time using `pyproj`, this is a library to work with cartographic projections and coordinate transformations.

The syntax `from pyproj.crs import CRS` means that from the `pyproj.crs` module of `pyproj` we *only* want to import the [`CRS` clhttps://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/dev/api/crs/crs.html).

## `DataFrame` to `GeoDataFrame`

Our first step is to import the
