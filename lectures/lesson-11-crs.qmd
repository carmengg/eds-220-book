# Coordinate Reference Systems

In this section we review what is a Coordinate Reference System (CRS).

## What is a CRS?

Since the Earth does not comme with lines and numbers etched on it, us humans need to create a system to locate places on it. 
A way to solve this is to use a coordinate reference system (CRS). 
A CRS is, at its core, a way to represent places on the Earth as coordinates.

To understand what are the components of a CRS it can be useful to think of the process we would undergo to match places on the Earth to numbers (coordinates) that represent them.

### 1.  Ellipsoid: Pick a shape for the Earth

Start with the Earth. 
Our planet is not a perfect spehere. 
Apart from its rugged surface with high mountains and deep ocean trenches, the shape of the Earth is not round. 
Due to the Earth's rotation, the planet is slightly wider at the Equator. 
Thus, a sphere is not the best way to model the shape of the Earth. 
Instead, we use an **ellipsoid**. 
Think of an [ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid) as a sphere that has been flattened a bit, thus making it wider across one axis. 
This is the first step for creating a CRS: picking an ellipsoid, a.k.a picking a shape for the Earth. 
The ellipsoid used to represent the Earth's shape has changed across time and it also changes by application.

### 2. Datum: Allign the ellipsoid with Earth's locations

The ellipsoid is an abstract mathematical object on which we can locate points on it by using angles. 
The coordinate system on the ellipsoid is (angles from x, angles form y). 

[Latitude and longtide are angular coordinates on the ellipsoid. [Source: Coordinate systems and map projections - University of Twente](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/learningoutcome/show/59273)](/images/crs/lat_lon_ellipsoid.jpg)

The next step is thus to make a decision on how to allign the ellipsoid so that it's surface corresponds to actual places on the Earth. 
We could think, for example of how to place the ellipsoid's center relative to Earth's mass center (is it the same or is it off?) or how to allign the ellipsoid's axes with the Earth (which meridian will be our prime meridian?). 
Generally speaking, a **geodetic datum**, or just **datum**, is how we are alligning our abstract ellipsoid to match the Earth's surface.

## Many datums
Geographers and cartographers have created and used *many* datums across time and applications. 
Sometimes datum refers both to a choice of ellipsoid *and* how to allign it to the Earth. 
More importantly, different datums are used to increase the accuracy of representing different regions of Earth. 
At the [GIS wiki](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Datum_(geodesy)) you can see a list of names of different datums optimized for different regions.

### 3. Geographic CRS: Lat/lon coordinates for all the world

At this point, we have successfully made a correspondence between the Earth's surface of and our ellipsoid. 
This means we can now use the lat,lon coordinates of the ellipsoid to locate *any* point on the Earth's sruface. 
What we have now is a **geographic CRS**. 
Geographic coordinate reference systems use degrees of latitude and longitude to locate points on the Earth, still thinking of it as a 3D object.

### 4. Projection: Flatten a portion of your ellipsoid to make a planar map

A map is a flat (2-dimensional) representation of a region of the Earth. 
In a geographic CRS we use a 3-dimensional model of the Earth (the ellipsoid) to locate places on it. 
To transform our 3D ellipsoid to make a 2D representation we need to use a projection. 
A **projection** is a method to convert between angular coordinates (i.e. lat, long coordiantes in 3D) and planar coordnates (i.e. x, y coordinates in 2D).

## Many projections
There are *many* ways to project an ellipsoid into a 2-dimensional region. 
However, no matter what projection we use, the area, distances, or angles of the actual regions on Earth will be distorted when we project. 
Ultimately, the choice of projection relies on whether we want to optimze calculations involving area, angle, or distance measurements, as well as aesthetics when creating a map.

### 5. Projected CRS: x,y coordinates for a specific region

When we project a region of the ellipsoid to represent a region of Earth on the plane we obtain a new set of planar coordinates, thus obtaining a **projected CRS**. 
A projected CRS must also include a **unit of measure** for its axes.
