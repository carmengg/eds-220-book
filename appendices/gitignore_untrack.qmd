# Gitignore & Git Untracking

This is a review on how to never track and untrack files in Git.

## Gitignore
The easiest way to have Git never track a file or directory within your Git directory is to add it to the gitignore file *before you ever start tracking it*. 

From the [Git documenatation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore):

>A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected.

This means the files listed in the gitignore will be ignored when making a commit. They are ignored by Git and will not appear when we check the Git status. 


## Creating a .gitignore

### When creating a GitHub repository
The easiest way to create a gitignore is probably when creating a repository through GitHub. 
To do this:

1. Go to the "Add .gitignore" section and...

![](/images/git/add-gitignore.png)

2. ...select a template from the list. These templates are provided by GitHub to ignore unuseful files in different programming languages. For this course we select the Python .gitignore template. 

![](/images/git/select-gitignore-template.png)

3. When you finish creating your new repository, the .gitignore file will be in it. 

### From the GitHub .gitignore templates

If you don't have a .gitignore yet and want to add the one from the GitHub template you can:

1. Download the .gitignore GitHub template from their website: [https://github.com/github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

2. Move it to your directory.

3. Update the name to `.gitignore`. 

### From the command line 
What if we we just want to create our own blank .gitignore? 
No problem, we can create one from our terminal:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Verify you don't have a .gitignore:
```{bash}
ls -a
```

Adding `-a` to the `ls` (list) command will show all the files, including the hidden files that start with a period `.`, such as the .gitignore. 

3. Create a new .gitignore file for the directory:

```{bash}
touch .gitignore
```

If there is no output, everything worked. 

4. Check your .gitgnore is there:
```{bash}
ls -a
```

You should see the .gitignore now listed in the files. 


## Editing .gitignore

### Add a file
Suppose you have an **untracked file** called `example.txt` that we want to add to our .gitignore. 
Untracked means Git hasn't began tracking changes on this file and, if you rung `git status` this file should appear under Untracked files. 

If you are using JupyterLab, you'll need to edit the .gitignore from the terminal to add `example.txt` to it:
Follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Open the .gitignore file in the nano command line-based text editor:

```{bash}
nano .gitignore
```

3. Once in the editor, add a new line with the name of the file: `example.txt`. 

4. To exit nano: 
    - `Ctrl+X`, 
    - Press `Y` to save the changes
    - Press `Enter` 

5. When you run `git status` again, `example.txt` is not listed in untracked files. 

### Add a directory

## Untracking
Once a file has been added to a commit, Git starts tracking it. 
If we add the file's name to the .gitignore after it has been commited, Git will keep tracking changes in it. 
To stop tracking a tracked file `example.txt`:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Run `git rm --cached example.txt`. 
The `git rm --cached` command will remove the file from the Git tracking while leaving the file untouched on disk. 

3. If it's not already there, add `example.txt` to .gitignore so Git ignores it.
