This section contains instructions for creatiog a Personal Access Token (PAT):

In GitHub navigate to:
settings
developer settings (last option on the left)
tokens (classic)
generate new token button (near right corner)
Click on: Generate new token (classic)
Select the following options:
☑️ Repo (clicking this will select all boxes in the section, that’s ok)
☑️ workflow
☑️ gist
☑️ user (clicking this will select all boxes in the section, that’s ok)
Click generate token.

Copy and paste the PAT somewhere for now!

Back at the terminal try to push your changes again using git push. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and the new PAT as the password.

Note
In steps 1-5 we generated a PAT manually. This is the same process as using usethis::create_github_token from an R console as explained in the MEDS installation guide. The options we selected in step 2 are the same options for the PAT given by usethis::create_github_token.
