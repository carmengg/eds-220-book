In steps 1-5 we generated a PAT manually. 
This is the same process as using `usethis::create_github_token` from an R console as explained in the [MEDS installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-mac.html#store-your-github-personal-access-token-pat). 
The options we selected in step 2 are the same options for the PAT given by  `usethis::create_github_token`.
