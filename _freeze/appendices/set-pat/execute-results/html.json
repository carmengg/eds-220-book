To store the PAT once it's created, first run this command on the terminal:\n\n\n```{bash}\n#| eval: false\ngit config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'\n```\n\n\n2. In [GitHub](https://github.com) navigate to:\n\n- settings\n- developer settings (last option on the left)\n- tokens (classic)\n- generate new token button (near right corner)\n- Click on: Generate new token (classic)\n\n\n3. Select the following options:\n\n- ☑️ Repo (clicking this will select all boxes in the section, that’s ok)\n- ☑️ workflow\n- ☑️ gist\n- ☑️ user  (clicking this will select all boxes in the section, that’s ok)\n\n4. Click generate token.\n\n5. Copy and paste the PAT somewhere for now! \n\n6. Back at the terminal try to push your changes again using `git push`. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and the new PAT as the password.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nIn steps 1-5 we generated a PAT manually. \nThis is the same process as using `usethis::create_github_token` from an R console as explained in the [MEDS installation guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/meds-install-mac.html#store-your-github-personal-access-token-pat). \nThe options we selected in step 2 are the same options for the PAT given by  `usethis::create_github_token`.\n:::\n\n",
